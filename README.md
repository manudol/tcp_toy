# TCP toy project

The goal of this project is to implement the basic features of the Transmission Control Protocol.

## To compile, run:
```sh
make -B
```

## To run:
- Open 2 terminals
- In the first one, start the server with:
```sh
./s
```
- In the second one, start the client with:
```sh
./c
```

## Notes
Note 1: You can start multiple clients in multiple terminal to communicate with the server.

Note 2: Works only currently on localhost. But I plan to expand it to local network soon.
